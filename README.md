# Mastermind - Version 1.2

## General Information
This program was created by Lennhard Wartena and Tobias JÃ¼lg during school lession in 2014. It consits of one source file `mastermind_1.3.py` which contains all source code and the folder Compiled_Mastermind with the file `mastermind.exe`. This file is a compiled version which should work on windows machines. If you open this version there will be an error showing about an update function, this can be ignored.

The program is an implementation of the famous game board game [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)). For more information have a lock on my website I have created an [atricle](http://mineyourlife.net/mastermind-mein-erstes-selbstprogrammiertes-spiel/) about this implementation but it's in german.

## Implementation
The game is implemented in Python and requires the module [VisualPython](http://vpython.org/) to run the graphic 3D engine.
